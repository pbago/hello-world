# Title (1)
Starting GitHub

Hello! This is my first change in a repository.

## Title (1.1)

I'm trying different __styling__ options I can use here. Text can be emphasised in **different** ways. If I want to *italicize* a text, I can also do it in _two_ different ways. What if I write something that is a ~~~mistake~~? What if I write something that is **_extremely_** __*important*__?

Like someone said:
> Just do it!

You can emphasise `code` within text. Or you can use a block of code:

```
print "Rezultat je " + str(x) + "."
```

This is a link to [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

### Title (1.1.1)

I can make a bulleted list:
* element
* another element
* another another element.

Or:
- element
- element
- element.

Ordered lists:
1. need numbers
2. to be ordered.

For nested lists:
1. you have to
  1. indent lines
  2. by two spaces.
    - end nested list.
2. Element.

Task lists are used to:
- [ ] create lists of tasks
- [ ] to do
- [x] or that are already done.
